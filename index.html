<p>My summer started off with a trip to Italy. My older sister, Rachel, studied abroad in Italy for a semester, so my mom and I thought it would be a great time to visit. We started our adventure in Milan, the fashion capitol. The Duomo was my favorite attraction I got to see in Milan.  We also did some shopping in the city. Later on in the week we traveled to Florence and Lucca. It was a beautiful trip and I would love to go back.  </p>

<H1> Flaggler Beach </H1>
</div>
<p>Every summer my family goes on a summer beach vacation in Florida. This year we went to a Flaggler Beach. Its not a very touristy area, so most of the week we relaxed on the beach. My favorite part of the trip this year was watching my labrador puppy, Annie, swim in the ocean for the first time. </P>

<p>My final summer adventure was to Guatemala. I traveled with a medical missions team around Guatemala to get impoverished families medical care. This trip was by far my favorite part of the summer and I look forward to going back one day. </P>
